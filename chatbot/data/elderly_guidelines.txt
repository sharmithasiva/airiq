Air Quality Guidelines for Elderly People:

1. **Monitor AQI Levels:**  
   - Check the AQI before going outdoors. If AQI is above 100 (Moderate), limit outdoor activity.  
   - Prefer indoor activities when AQI is Poor or Very Poor.

2. **Protective Measures:**  
   - Wear an N95 or equivalent mask when stepping outside during moderate or poor air quality.  
   - Keep windows closed and use an air purifier indoors.  
   - Avoid areas with heavy traffic or construction dust.

3. **Exercise Safely:**  
   - Do light indoor exercises like yoga, stretching, or walking on a treadmill.  
   - Avoid strenuous outdoor exercises during high pollution days.

4. **Health Monitoring:**  
   - Monitor heart and respiratory symptoms, as elderly individuals are more susceptible to pollution-related complications.  
   - Keep inhalers or prescribed medications handy if you have chronic respiratory or cardiovascular conditions.

5. **Hydration & Nutrition:**  
   - Drink plenty of water to help flush out pollutants.  
   - Eat antioxidant-rich foods (fruits and vegetables) to support lung health.

6. **Consult a Doctor:**  
   - If you notice increased coughing, shortness of breath, chest discomfort, or other health changes, consult a healthcare professional immediately.

**Reminder:** Even on “moderate” days, elderly individuals should be cautious and minimize exposure.
